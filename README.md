# Functions

## [throttle.js](throttle.js)

This limits the callback of events to a user-specified duration.

Useful for making API calls from user key presses.

## [anchor.js](anchor.js)

Enables smooth scrolling when clicking on anchor links.
Also highlights the anchor, both on click and on page load, when the fragment part of the URI is a anchor on the page.

## [headerLink.js](headerLink.js)

Adds buttons to headers to get a link to the page & anchor.
